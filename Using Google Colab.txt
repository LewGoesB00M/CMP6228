StackOverflow threads and personal experience show that Google Colab begins to horrifically lag after
roughly 40 minutes of continued use. To fix this, the tab needs to be refreshed.

This is particularly an issue when considering Colab cannot save files from Github without making 
commits for them. Perhaps use a new branch for assignment work in Colab?
