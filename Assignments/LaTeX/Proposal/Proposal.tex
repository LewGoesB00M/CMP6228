\chapter*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

In this report, a novel solution is proposed to address a significant data science problem in the medical field, in the form of 
a deep neural network to accurately identify the presence of pneumonia from an image of a chest X-ray. To do so, this neural network 
will be trained on a publicly available dataset that has been previously seen across many publications, and advanced techniques 
for the model will be discussed.

\para This proposal will specifically cover the motivation behind this project before exploring related literature and previous works 
in great depth. To conclude, an optimal model will be proposed based on the knowledge extracted from these related works. 

% ! Weak. Come back to this probably at the very end.


\chapter{Motivation and objectives}

\section{Subject area}

Pneumonia is a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) commonly caused by viruses or bacteria wherein the alveoli of the lungs 
become clogged with pus and fluid, which can be life-threatening in people of any age, but especially in children and the elderly
\autocite{nhsPneumonia2017}. The World Health Organisation (WHO) state that pneumonia is the single largest infectious cause of death 
in children, killing 808,000 children under the age of 5 in 2017 \autocite{whoPneumonia}. Furthermore, even if pneumonia is survived during the initial 
infection, \textcite{allinsonEarlyChildhoodLower2023} studied that those who contract the condition as a child are 93\% more likely to die from 
respiratory diseases later in life than those who did not.

\para It is therefore imperative that recent technological advancements are leveraged for the quick diagnosis of the infection to allow swift 
treatment to avoid life-threatening consequences, both in the short-term and long-term. 

\section{Dataset choice}
The chosen dataset is sourced from the Mendeley data repository \autocite{mendeleydataLargeDatasetLabeled}, uploaded and created by  
\textcite[p.1127]{kermanyIdentifyingMedicalDiagnoses2018} in their research of the applications of neural networks for medical diagnoses.
The dataset contains 5,856 images of chest X-ray scans of children taken from the
Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center in China, and is 1.18GB in size. \textcite[p.e1]{kermanyIdentifyingMedicalDiagnoses2018} 
state that the data was heavily screened and scrutinized for confirmation before labelling, which was done by removing low quality or unreadable images,
and then consulting two expert physicians before labelling the images. The physicians' labelled set was then presented to a third expert, 
who confirmed their validity. Because of this, there is absolute certainty in the authenticity and validity of the data itself as well as its 
ground truth labels.
There are only two classes of images: those with 
pneumonia and those without, as depicted by Figures \ref{fig:SampleNORMAL} and \ref{fig:SamplePNEUMONIA}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Proposal/SampleNORMAL.jpeg}
    \caption{A sample image without pneumonia.\label{fig:SampleNORMAL}}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Proposal/SamplePNEUMONIA.jpeg}
    \caption{A sample image with pneumonia.\label{fig:SamplePNEUMONIA}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Potential issues}
The dataset has already been pre-emptively split into training and testing sets, which saves having to perform a manual split. 
However, the data itself is not immediately usable and will require further preprocessing before being used to train a model, namely due to the 
following issues:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Images are different resolutions.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The sample images vary widely in resolution, with some being substantially higher than others.
        The neural network's input layer will be fixed in size, meaning all input data must be the 
        same size or the network will be unable to process it. This can be addressed programmatically using Keras to automatically resize 
        all images to a given resolution.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Class imbalance
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The training set contains 1,349 samples of patients without pneumonia, but 3,883 samples of patients with pneumonia.
        This will lead to the model favouring those with pneumonia rather than the underrepresented class of those without. This can be addressed 
        using the techniques discussed in Appendix A.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Data science problem}

development of a neural network image classification model leveraging supervised learning. The ground truth is present within

\noindent Files of the appropriate class are stored in the relevant subfolder. When this dataset is loaded, it will be possible to 
assign the relevant label to each image based on its subfolder of origin. Note that while there are separate files for bacterial and 
viral pneumonia, an analysis of other works using this dataset, seen in Chapter 2, indicated that this will not be an issue.
