\chapter{Proposed method}
"Provide a full description of the proposed
methodology including the pre-processing phase."

% What deep learning methods will you use? Why?
% How will you preprocess your data?

\section{Data ingestion}
Maybe not necessary to be its own section - if it is, it'll have to be brief given 
the heavily limited word count on this assignment.

\section{Data pre-processing}
% Images in full RGB will enormously increase necessary processing time.
% Things like greyscale conversion could go here. Not sure what else there is with images.
